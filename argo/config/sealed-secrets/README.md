# 🔐 Sealed Secrets — Secure GitOps Secret Management

This document explains what **Sealed Secrets** are, why they are secure, how they work, and when you should consider using them in a GitOps-based Kubernetes environment.

---

## ✅ What is a Sealed Secret?

A **SealedSecret** is an encrypted Kubernetes Secret that is safe to store in a public or private Git repository.

- It uses **asymmetric encryption**: the secret is encrypted with a **public key** and can only be decrypted by the **private key** stored in the Sealed Secrets controller running inside your cluster.
- The controller watches for `SealedSecret` resources and automatically decrypts them into standard Kubernetes `Secret` resources.

> Sealed Secrets are created using the CLI tool `kubeseal`, and decrypted by the `sealed-secrets-controller` inside your cluster.

---

## 🔐 Why is it Secure?

- **Only your Kubernetes cluster** (specifically, your Sealed Secrets controller) has the private key to decrypt the sealed secret.
- Even if someone copies the SealedSecret from your **public GitHub repo**, they **cannot decrypt it**.
- The encryption uses strong, industry-standard asymmetric cryptography.

### 🔐 Example Analogy:
> Encrypting a secret using `kubeseal` is like putting a message in a locked mailbox — only the person with the **private key** (your cluster) can open it.

---

## 🚫 Can Someone Else Use My Sealed Secret?

No. Here's why:

- SealedSecrets are encrypted **with your cluster's public key**.
- Another user or cluster has a **different Sealed Secrets controller with a different private key**.
- Therefore, your SealedSecret is **undecryptable** outside of your original cluster.

Even if someone:
- Clones your GitHub repo
- Applies your `SealedSecret` in their cluster

They will get an error:
```
error decrypting sealed secret: cannot decrypt data with this key
```

✅ So you can safely commit SealedSecrets to Git.

## 🧠 When Should I Use Sealed Secrets?

### ✅ Use Sealed Secrets when:
- You want to store encrypted secrets **in Git** (especially public repos)
- You’re doing **automated, GitOps-style cluster provisioning** (like with ArgoCD)
- You’re working in a team and want secrets to be version-controlled and reproducible
- You want to **eliminate manual secret creation** after every cluster reset
- You manage **multiple clusters or environments** with consistent secrets

### 🚫 Maybe don't use Sealed Secrets when:
- You’re just prototyping or working solo and don’t mind running `kubectl create secret` manually
- You don’t rotate clusters often and prefer simpler setups
- You have a secure and manual secrets management workflow that fits your current needs

---

## 🔄 Key Lifecycle Tips

- When you **delete and recreate your cluster**, Sealed Secrets won’t decrypt unless the **original private key** is restored.

### ✅ To reuse the same SealedSecrets across cluster resets:
1. **Backup your private key**:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n kube-system get secret sealed-secrets-key -o yaml > ~/.sealed-secrets-backups/sealed-secrets-key.yaml
   ```

2. **Restore it to new clusters** before installing the controller:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ~/.sealed-secrets-backups/sealed-secrets-key.yaml
   ```

3. Then install Sealed Secrets **with the `existingSecret=true` option**.
